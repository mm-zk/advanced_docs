# Advanced documentation

This documentation is aimed at advanced users who are interested in developing the zkSyncERA itself (rather than just
the contracts on top) - and would like to understand how the system works internally.

The documents in this directory are not meant to be a full specification, but give you the rough understanding of the
system internals.

Suggested order of reading:

- 01_initialization
- deposit
- withdrawal
- contracts
